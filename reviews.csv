I always pay in full but sometimes partial payment gave the consumer the power for flexible payment and maximum usage of money.",1,80,2.94.0,2023-11-24 20:37:39,,,2.94.0,newest,com.paymaya

This platform is no longer intended for traders like me. The spread is now too wide that it's literally impossible to carry out daily trading without incurring losses. For example, if you buy Ethereum they will sell it at 2% higher price than other trading platforms like Binance; now if you want to sell it they will buy it at 2% cheaper price than when you buy it just a second ago. Two percent seems a pretty small number but 2% of 1 million is 20,000.",3,154,3.6.11,2021-09-19 00:42:52,"Hi there!
